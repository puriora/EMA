    "# Low-Order N-Gram Based English Phonotactics Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to research:\n",
    "1. Are there patterns in how English words are constructed? If so, can the patterns be used to replicate the acceptability judgements of a native English Speaker?\n",
    "2. Are there certain combinations of characters that give a word or a name certain impression? (i.e., are there patterns in female names that gives them a sense of femininity?) \n",
    "3. Can low-order n-gram generative models capture English phonotactics, simply by the surface analysis of the characters instead of their underlying sounds? If so, how low can n go until the model fails?"

    "\n",
    "Messy data:\n",
    "I would have to turn lists of words into a DataFrame. I would have to analyze it with n-gram models and break down each word to an array of characters to do so, and result in many arrays of floats. I would also like other datasets of male and female names on the side and merge them with the word list to replicate actual English phonotactic behaviors. \n",
    "\n",
    "New library:\n",
    "I would like to explore more plots and even interactive ones. I currently have my eyes on altair. My only current ideas are heatmaps, and plots where if you put your cursor over, more information would show up. I think it is important to show the findings intuitively."

    "## Data Setting and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Most of the code and processing was done in Java. The results of the processing is what will be analyzed here. This was permitted by the staff (https://edstem.org/us/courses/76716/discussion/6760495). Code is in EMA.java. Java code that performed each data transformation will have their snippets posted below each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, I will use \"Context\" and \"Content\" to describe the inputs and outputs of an n-gram model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Setting: 10k words compiled by the MIT, and 2000 boy and girl names from the SSA. They all have weird outliers, but there are also enough good cases to ignore them. The model is made to handle lowercase characters only, so some uppercase characters would have to be converted before processing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Transformation: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take in a document of words (.txt)\n",
    "\t(It can be tested by trying to print every word in the file and see if the file is being loaded or not.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(fileName)); // Uses a scanner to read the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remove instances of dashes, turn uppercase characters into lowercase for easier processing. <>\n",
    "\t(It can be tested by printing every word in the file and see if it only contains lowercase characters)\n",
    "\n",
    "String word = \"\" + nul + stx + sc.nextLine().trim().toLowerCase() + end; \n",
    "\n",
    "nul is the placeholder for the trigrams that needs two previous characters to generate the next character; stx (start of text) is the placeholder for bigrams and trigrams that needs one or two previous characters to generate the next character; nextLine is because each word is on it's own line; trim is to remove unnecessary spaces; toLowerCase because the model can't handle anything outside of a-z; end is a special character used to see how many times the end of a word is what follows a letter (represented as etx on the tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Have an array that keeps track of how many times each of the 26 letters appear in the list of words (unigram, index of the array is equal to the character it represents, 0=a, 1=b…), and a dictionary that keeps track of how many times each 26 letters (or the end of a word) appear after each of the 26 letters (or start of a word) (bigram). The bigram would end up with 27 keys, each with an array with 27 slots for numbers. Higher-order n-grams would be constructed in similar fashion, with dictionary that takes tuples instead of single keys.\n",
    "\t(The unigram array can be tested by searching instances of character with ctrl+f, and see if the total instance of a certain character is matching with the data in the array. The bigram array is harder to test, but intuitions of English can help: c is not likely to be followed by a z, so if there are a lot of cases of c being followed by a z, then something is wrong with how data is stored.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with trigram training: (model.trigram is a Map<String, Vector>)\n",
    "\n",
    "String s = \"\" + c + word.charAt(i + 1); // two letter combination that acts as the context for what is generated next.\n",
    "\n",
    "if (!model.trigram.containsKey(s)) { // if there isn't already an entry for s, add a new one. New entries are dynamically created instead of being fully initialized at the start (like the bigram models), due to there being a lot more possible entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    model.trigram.put(s, new Vector(vdim)); // put in a new vector of vdim, which is 27 (26 letters, plus etx)\n",
    "    \n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "    model.trigram.get(s).add(word.charAt(i + 2)); // add this instance of context and content pair into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Methods of smoothing are applied (optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add k smoothing: each number in each array for unigram and bigram models are added by a constant k (usually 0 < k < 1), to make it so that rare cases that are not covered by the dataset will not show up as zero.\n",
    "\t(Simply print the arrays before and after the method, and see if there is an extra k added to each number in the arrays.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with trigram again:\n",
    "\n",
    "trigram.forEach((key, value) -> { // for each entry in the map...\n",
    "\n",
    "    trigram.get(key).add(smoothie, 1); // add smoothie, which is a vector of vdims, populated with k, a parameter decided in code. The bigger k is, the less relied on training the model is.\n",
    "    \n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "    Stupid backoff (only for bigrams and beyond): if there are no instances of a letter followed by another (for example, x followed by a), the algorithm goes back one level and tries to find the possibility of the second character with one less precedent for it (following the example, the possibility of a appearing alone), and it keep tries to go back until a none zero value is found. That value is multiplied with a constant (experimentally 0.4) and is plugged back into the original array in its slot.\n",
    "\t(Check the case of x coming before a. The chance might be low enough for backoff to happen, and since a is quite common on its own, one would expect to see the first value in the array when x is input into the dictionary for bigram is quite high, and approximately a portion of the chance of a appearing on its own)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really only used in trigrams during generation and perplexity calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "double sum = Math.log(model.trigram.getOrDefault(s, model.bigram.get(s.charAt(1))).get(word.charAt(0) - 'a')); // Due to being dynamically created, there can be cases where trigrams can't \"follow up\" after a character. This is when it falls back to the bigram version with getOrDefault, which turns to the default if normal get returns a null.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Normalization: the times that letter x appears after letter y is divided by all cases of x appearing, as an example for a bigram model. This makes it so that the sum of possibility of every number in every array is 1, for any n in n-gram. Now, they can be seen as possibilities.\n",
    "\t(Sum up every index of the arrays and see if it adds up to one. A specific function can be written for that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Trigram example again:\n",
    "\n",
    "trigram.forEach((key, value) -> { // for each entry in the map...\n",
    "\n",
    "    trigram.get(key).normalize(value.total(false)); // call the normalize function on each vector, which just divides every value by a value, which is the total of the vector values here. This makes it so that the total value of every double stored to add up to one.\n",
    "    \n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "(You might be curious about the false parameter. That is there to make the etx value to not interfere when generating words. Experimentally it works well. This does mean that etx will NOT be normalized along with the rest of the context-content pair.)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. With more formatting and iterating through the dictionary, we now have a DataFrame for our data. It can now be used to generate words (going through the dictionary/array based on the model used, and use the probability of the next character to determine it, then use that as basis to find the next most likely character, etc.), used for perplexity calculations (or to see how “English” a word is, by seeing the possibility of it being generated by our model), and have plots made of it with altair (heatmaps, etc.).\n",
    "\t(Show the results to native English speakers and see if there are anything surprising for them. Sadly, the name generation function won't be able to be showcased here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how a bigram model (Map<Character, Vector>) is turned into a csv file (assuming correct imports):\n",
    "\n",
    "String bigram_name = path + \"csv_\" + model.name + \"_bigram.csv\"; // the right file name\n",
    "\n",
    "File bigram = new File(bigram_name); // making a file with the right file name\n",

They will each have a unigram version, bigram version, and a trigram version, as indicated by their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to test whether the outputs of these are correct, go to the corresponding word file and (for example) search for \"ba\" in page. If there are, say, 208 cases, this means that the bigram csv file in row \"b\", column \"a\" should also have 208 as its value. Searching \"sta\" in word file means you should look for row \"st\" and column \"a\" in the trigram file, etc. For unigram, just search how many x letters there are, and see the columns."

    "\n",
    "First, to answer the first research question: ***\"Are there patterns in how English words are constructed? If so, can the patterns be used to replicate the acceptability judgements of a native English Speaker?\"***\n",
    "The answer would be an obvious yes. There are cases where one letter is more likely to follow the other than anything else. Seeing the probability distribution given a context (which, for unigrams, is no context; for bigrams, is one character preceding the content; for trigrams, is two characters preceding the content.)\n",
    "(Note: this works for all low-order n-grams, but bigram works the best visually. unigram would return a single bar (because it can appear in any context), while trigram would return too many.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that it isn't a uniform distribution shows that there are patterns more likely or less likely in English. And yes, I believe the results are self explanatory and intuitive. If some odd cases seems to have a high probability, that would be a problem with the word set (It infamously includes \"words\" like \"xhtml\", \"xxx\", \"acdbentity\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**(It is important to know what the bars actually represents here, since there are two different context for it! When the table isn't smoothed or normalized, the column vector that the bar represents simply adds up to all occurences of *content*. This does not mean that when the table is smoothed, the column vector adds up to one! This is because the normalization is done based on row vectors instead of columns. This is best illustrated by seeing the normalized and not normalized words_bi, given content 'u'. 'u' has many potential context, 'o', 's', and 't', but when the row vectors are normalized, 'u' would not stand out from 'o', 's', and 't'. Instead, 'u' would stand out from 'q', because 'q' is usually comes before 'u' in most cases. This shows that normalization shows the \"true\" context-content pairs.)**"

    "Lastly, ***\"Can low-order n-gram generative models capture English phonotactics, simply by the surface analysis of the characters instead of their underlying sounds? If so, how low can n go until the model fails?\"*** The second question will be quite clear once we answer the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimentally (on the Java code that can't be run here), unigram and bigram model were disastrous when it came to generating English sounding words:\n",
    "(These are generated by the commands \"gen words 1 10\" and \"gen words 2 10\")\n",

    "Ten words generated by unigram: (amnaoia, lmpetyipentnr, obeutdv, osneniren, snlloerf, dswrocua, isaonssbeo, areg, loaetszg, lsiosen)\n",

    "Ten words generated by trigram: (tompire, earchicin, falfs, plecha, asoroction, mitorme, bdishourga, pasip, bentionsies, naterce)\n",
    "\n",
    "The unigram was expectedly bad, but bigrams unexpectedly underperformed. This was likely due to the amount of two letter consonants combinations and their relative distributions. For example, \"ct\", which has many pairs, often appears in the middle or end of words (lactose, abstract, etc.). However, since 'c' is a very common first letter, it is not uncommon for that 'c' to be followed by a 't', leading to 'ct' in the beginning . With only one character input as context, there simply isn't enough memory for it to make the right pairs at the right time. This began to improve with trigrams, but there are still digraphs (like sh, ch, two letters that represent one sound) where it takes up too much context memory for it to perform well enough (reference \"earchicin\" in the trigram generations).\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to move on from surface (letter) based analysis, and turn to IPA, which represents digraphs with one symbol, and evades some other problem like the inconsistent spelling of English. However, it is likely going to be bloated, and how its many diacritics would be handled can also be affecting the model's performance based on different languages. There are goods of it too, in that currently, the model can only handle languages or latinization that uses the 26 latin alphabet. Switching to IPA would cover almost all languages, but what it can't do is to generate words that also *look* like English.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, low-order n-gram generative models does capture English phonotactics, and the lowest we can go is three."
